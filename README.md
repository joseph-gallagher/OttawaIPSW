# OttawaIPSW

My contribution to a group project in the Industrial Problem Solving Workshop, held jointly by the Fields Institute and the 
University of Ottawa in 2018. The question under investigation: how can we effectively use sensor technology in buildings 
(e.g. WiFi, CO_2, motion detector information) to predict building occupancy? 

Interactive R notebooks are available under 'scripts', and run on the data inside 'data' to generate a code-included version of the 
summarized story, available [here](https://joseph-gallagher.github.io/OttawaIPSW/).
